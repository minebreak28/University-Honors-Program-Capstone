# University Honors Program Capstone Portfolio

Sorry to disappoint; this is not a programming project. Instead, this repository hosts my NC State University Honors Program Portfolio, a compilation of my academic achievements, personal growth, and reflections during my time in the UHP. Explore this repository if you wish to gain insight into my journey, goals, and the valuable lessons I've learned along the way. While it may not contain code, it represents a significant part of my academic and personal development. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my experiences in the NC State University Honors Program!
