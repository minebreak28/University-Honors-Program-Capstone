The gym has been an invaluable asset to my undergraduate career in multiple ways, far beyond just physical fitness. It served as the best way to relieve stress, allowing me to clear my mind and be by myself after a long study session or an exhausting test. The gym has also been a space for social interaction and I've met countless friends and even networked with a few people there that I've met. Carmichael has been essential in teaching me the ways of discipline and spiritual self-empowerment.
