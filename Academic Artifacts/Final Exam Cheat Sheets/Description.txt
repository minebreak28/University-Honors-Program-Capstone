Having taken countless tests in my stay at NC State, I always find it fun to take a look at some of the "cheat" sheets that profesors have allowed me to utilize before exams. It's always funny to me how I try to cram as much information into a 8x11 inch lined paper using as small a handwriting as possible. Interestingly enough, I find that after writing such cheat sheets, I rarely will use them during the actual test. By the time I'm done preparing my sheet, I often find that I've internalized much of the information and therefore reducing my reliance on the sheet during my exam. Attached is two examples of a cheat sheet used during final exams for Calculus 3 and Advanced Algorithms.
