Arguably my single FAVORITE project in all of my undergraduate career, the board game I created as my final project for ENG265 - American Literature 1 was, to my belief, a pinnacle of my personal creative academia. It combined literary analysis, historical context, and an interactive board game to bring the themes and characters of early American literature to life. This board game did not just simply prove my understanding of the course content, but also demonstrated my creative process and critical thinking skills, necessary thatof a UHP scholar. A deeper analysis will be reported in the reflection paper, as always.
