Creativity and Diversity- A Domino Effect explores the relationship between diversity and creativity, particularly within STEM fields. Using historial examples such as that of Marie Curie, Steve Jobs, and Lenovo, I argue that creativity is signficantly enhanced by a diverse workplace. This diversity does not necessarily have to be demographic; it also includes a spectrum of experiences, cultures, and disciplines. I metaphorize the concept of creativity as the initial domino in a chain leading to innovation, societal advancements, and success. However, in my point of view, diversity is the gust of wind that topples this initial domino.
