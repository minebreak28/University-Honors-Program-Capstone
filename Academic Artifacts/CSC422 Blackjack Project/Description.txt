CSC422 was the first class that introduced me to machine learning. At the end of the course, another student and I worked together to apply various machine learning techniques to analyyze blackjack game data. Our project focused on exploring the effectiveness of card counting strategies and detecting anomalies in game play, which could indicate such strategies were being employed. We utilized a wide variety of techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis and the Isolation Forest algorithm, to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset and identify the most influential features in predicting card counting. This project not only allowed me to code a blackjack game from scratch, but also provided me with hands-on experience with real-world data analysis and introduced me to what it can be like if I were to pursue AI in the future.
