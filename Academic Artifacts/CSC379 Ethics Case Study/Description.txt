CSC379 was a mandatory class all computer science students must take in order to graduate. This class focused on the "ethics" of computer science; as they always say, with great power comes great responsibility. In the class, I was required to complete an ethical analysis on two case studies.

In Case Study 1, I was responsibile for concluding the ethicality of PreCrime Inc, a company specializing in predictive law enforcement activities. This case study explroes the ethical implications of predictive policing, the balance between profit and ethical conduct, and responsibilites of both active and passive stakeholders involved.

In Case Study 2, I was responsible for conductiong a thorough ethical analysis on the implications of introducing sexbots into the prostitution industry. Several ethical issues came to light, such as the potential for sexbots to affect customer behavior or fantasies, the economic and social impact on human sex workers, and the ethical considerations surrounding promises of risk-free companionship.

Further analysis of these two case studies and how they have impacted my journey at NC State will be discussed in the reflection paper.
