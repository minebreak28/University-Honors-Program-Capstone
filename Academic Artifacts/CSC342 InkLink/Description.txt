After finishing my web development internship at Prometheus group, my growing interest in web development led me to enroll in a course focusing on progressive web applications. This culminated in a collaborative final project that my group members and I called InkLink- a one-of-a-kind application that allowed people from all over the nation share and appreciate the unique art form of graffiti. Recognizing the often misunderstood and stereotyped nature of graffiti, We aimed to allow graffiti enthusiasts, tourists, and the common folk to appreciate graffiti for what its worth.

This is a brief description of the screenshots of InkLink attached. The upper image is a screenshot of the login screen; if a user has an account, they will be able to log in; otherwise, they can register to create a new account. The middle left screenshot depicts the homepage of InkLink; users can see recent graffiti posts that is popular or by people they follow. The middle right screenshot consists of a user profile, that shows a user's name, tag, number of posts, number of followers and following, as well as their posts. There are also options to contact the user, follow them, and check their followers and people they follow. Finally, the bottom image is a simple depiction of a user's ability to create a new post. After posting, users' feeds will refresh and update in real time.
