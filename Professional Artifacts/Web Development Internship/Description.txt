Last summer, I did a web development internship at Prometheus Group. Over the course of three months, I utilized frontend programming languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, backend languages like Java and Kotlin, and other programming tools like Git, Jira, and PostgreSQL to help my team solve analytical problems with clients. As my first technical internship, I learned a lot. Not only did this spark a passion for web development, but I understood what it would be like in the future to work in the software development industry.
