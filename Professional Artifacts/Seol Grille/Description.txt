Seol Grille is a Korean barbecue restaurant that I've been working at since 2022. Not only has it been paying my rent, but I've also learned valuable lessons regarding work ethics, time management, and teamwork, among other things. Attached are two images, one of me in my work uniform, and the other of me NOT in my work uniform. There was a halloween costume contest in which employees dressed to be the best, and lets just say I won by a landslide.
